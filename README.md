npm install
```

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4600/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

We use GitHub Actions to build the new version on release.

In order to build a new version, you need to create a new release on GitHub, using semver tags.
